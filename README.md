# Listen-Together
Synchronised Music controller for listening to Spotify together. <br />

This is a fullstack web application which is made using Django and React.js. Also I have integrated the third party Spotify API in the application. <br />

Users can join rooms or can create rooms to listen to music together. Hosts of the room need to authenticate their Spotify accounts before creating a room. <br />

A random 6 letter code will be generated for the room which can be used by other users to join the room. <br />

<br />

Hosts can change the settings of the room, they can change if users can Play/Pause a song and the minimum number of votes required to skip a song. <br />

![update room settings](https://github.com/PrasannaIITM/Listen-Together/blob/main/music_controller/images/update_room.png)
<br />

Users can vote to skip a song, and once the votes cross the minimum number of votes required, the song is skipped. <br />
